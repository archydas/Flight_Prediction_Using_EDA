# Flight_Prediction_Using_EDA
## Flight Price Prediction Using EDA
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict flight ticket prices based on various factors such as airline, departure time, arrival time, duration, and number of stops. By analyzing historical flight data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques, this project seeks to build a model that can accurately forecast flight prices, providing a useful tool for passengers and travel businesses to understand pricing trends and make informed decisions.
## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate flight prices based on key features. This can help users identify the best times to book flights and understand how factors like the date of booking and travel duration influence the price.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about flights, including:
a. Airline: The airline providing the service.
b. Date of Journey: The departure date of the flight.
c. Source and Destination: Cities where the flight departs from and arrives.
d. Route: The flight route with possible layovers.
e. Departure and Arrival Time: Times of departure and arrival.
f. Duration: Total flight duration.
g. Total Stops: Number of stops in the flight journey.
h. Price: The ticket price (target variable for prediction).
